# React-Mini-Project
Weather App using React &amp; Material UI

This project is a React-based Weather Application that demonstrates all the core concepts of React, including functional components, useState hook, props, state management, and API integration. It uses Material UI for building a modern and responsive UI. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays details such as temperature, humidity, and min/max values for any city or country entered in the search bar. The weather card updates dynamically with icons and background images that change according to weather conditions (sunny, rainy, or cold), delivering an engaging and interactive user experience.
